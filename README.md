# Todo API with Flask

This is the tenth project in Treehouse Python tech degree.

## Description

A fellow student of yours in the JavaScript Techdegree has just taken the Angular Basics course and has a 
pretty nice working Angular.js Todo app. They went a little farther and used the ng-resource plugin which allows the 
application to work automatically using RESTful practices. However, they donâ€™t have experience yet on the server side of 
things. But you do. Can you help them out?

- Make sure the API is versioned.
- When the app first starts it will attempt to fetch all Todos in the system. Handle the request and return all the Todos.
- When a Todo is created and the save link is clicked, it will make a request to the server. Handle the request by creating 
a Todo and setting the proper status code.
- When a previously saved Todo is updated and the save link is clicked, it will make a request to the server. Handle the 
request by updating the existing Todo.
- When a previously saved Todo is deleted and the save link is clicked, it will make a request to the server. Handle the 
deletion and return a blank response and the proper status code.
- Write unit tests to test that each view is displaying the correct information. Write unit tests to test that the models, 
classes, and other functions behave as expected.

## Extra Credit

- Increase test coverage to 90% or above.
- Add user authentication both for the API and Angular front-end.
